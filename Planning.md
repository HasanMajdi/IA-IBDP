### Definition of the problem 
My client is Mr. Pierre Lacoste, the Deputy Head of UWC ISAK Japan - he is supervising the team that locks up the buildings inside the school, the team's responsibility is to 
check-in the buildings, that no one is there after curfew, make sure the lights are off inorder to safe energy and be sustainable, and fainally to lock them up. and through out the proccess, 
the team has faced problems regarding the lights - as sometimes lights might be forrgoten on and not turned off, which creates a loss of energy and money.

### Solution proposed
Based on the information giving by Mr. Lacoste regarding the problem, I have decided to create a notification system that helps my client to follow the statu of the lights in the Gym - Mr. Lacoste and I have agreed on placing the System in the Gym because it is the place that will cause more loss of energy if forgotten on more than any other rooms, and that is due to its huge space and the lights needed to keep it on. 
I am going to use Arduino uno Board and that is because it is more convinient to use in this project rather than other boards such as Rassberyy pi even thogh, there is no comparission between both, Arduino board is just like having a calculator while rassberyy pi is more like a computer, and obviosley i do not need a computer for this project, in addition, Arduino is avaliable for me here in School with most of its tools, it is based on easy-to-use hardware and software, also,  I have some experinces with it before, as we have programed a project with it before as a School IA practise. over all, the system will notify the team that they have forgotten a light on. That will be developed using a light sensor in the Arduino to check the statu of the ligths, a Wifi modlue that will connect the arduino to the internet inorder to send the notification emaill.
