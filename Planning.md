### Definition of the problem 
My client is Mr. Pierre Lacoste, the Deputy Head of UWC ISAK Japan - he is supervising the team that locks up the buildings inside the school, the team's responsibility is to 
check-in the buildings, that no one is in there after curfew, make sure the lights are off and windows closed inorder to safe energy and be sustainable,  and fainally to lock them up. and through out the proccess, 
the team has faced problems regarding the lights - as sometimes lights might be forrgoten on and not turned off, which creates a loss of energy and money.

### Solution proposed
Based on the information giving by Mr. Lacoste regarding the problem, I have decided to create a notification system that helps my client to follow the statu of the lights in the Gym - Mr. Lacoste and I have agreed on placing the System in the Gym because it is the place that will cause more loss of energy if forgotten on more than any other rooms, and that is due to its huge space and the lights needed to keep it on. 
I am going to use Arduino uno Board and that is because it is more convinient to use in this project rather than other boards such as Rassberyy pi even thogh, there is no comparission between both, Arduino board is just like having a calculator while rassberyy pi is more like a computer, and obviosley i do not need a computer for this project, in addition, Arduino is avaliable for me here in School with most of its tools, it is based on easy-to-use hardware and software, also,  I have some experinces with it before, as we have programed a project with it before as a School IA practise. over all, the system will notify the team that they have forgotten a light on, and we can assume if the lights are forgotten that they did not close the windows nor lock up. That will be developed using a light sensor in the Arduino to check the statu of the ligths, a Wifi modlue that will connect the arduino to the internet inorder to send the notification emaill.

### Feasibility Study

**TELOS** is a method in project management used to define five areas of feasibility that determine whether
a project should run or not. 

In this **Internal Assessment**, I will be Developing a notification system for Mr. Lacoste to serve the purpose of avoiding energy loss in UWC ISAK Japan.  

The notification system successfully passes the TELOS feasibility:

The system is **technically feasible.** I will be using Arduino Uno/Nano to make the system happen, both the hardware and software part - Arduino 
will allow me to plug sensors and connect to wifi in order to notify the team responsible for the locking up. 

The system is **economically feasible.** The developing tools are availiable and not needed to be paid - also the user would be able to use it without paying
since internet is avaliable at the location of use. 

The system is **legally feasible.** There are no regulations against any of the technical or logistical parts of the System. 

The system is **operationally feasible.** This system will not cause any conflicts with any other operations - it can be placed anywhere and does not require any software connections to be ran (except the first set-up). 

The system is **well scheduled**. It will take about two months to be developed. Time is needed to research about Arduino (Hardware & Software) and Wifi Module also to learn how to send E-mails by Arduino - There needs to be meetings with the client. As it is an Internal Assessment by IB, We will be following a schedule provided by the Teacher of Computer Science. 

### Success Criteria

| No. | Success Criteria                                                                             |
|:---:|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1   | The system is convenient and easy to use.                                                    |
| 2   | The system is not connected to a computer nor plugged to a socket. (9V Battery will be used) |
| 3   | The system should be able to identify if the lights in the designated room is on.            |
| 4   | When lights are forgotten on (After 9:45 PM) - System should notify the team by E-mail.      |
| 5   | Documentation should be provided with the system.                                            |
