**TELOS** is a method in project management used to define five areas of feasibility that determine whether
a project should run or not. 

In this **Internal Assessment**, I will be Developing a notification system for Mr. Lacoste to serve the purpose of avoiding energy loss in UWC ISAK Japan.  

The notification system successfully passes the TELOS feasibility:

The system is **technically feasible.** I will be using Arduino Uno/Nano to make the system happen, both the hardware and software part - Arduino 
will allow me to plug sensors and connect to wifi in order to notify the team responsible for the locking up. 

The system is **economically feasible.** The developing tools are availiable and not needed to be paid - also the user would be able to use it without paying
since internet is avaliable at the location of use. 

The system is **legally feasible.** There are no regulations against any of the technical or logistical parts of the System. 

The system is **operationally feasible.** This system will not cause any conflicts with any other operations - it can be placed anywhere and does not require any software connections to be ran (except the first set-up). 

The system is **well scheduled**. It will take about two months to be developed. Time is needed to research about Arduino (Hardware & Software) and Wifi Module also to learn how to send E-mails by Arduino - There needs to be meetings with the client. As it is an Internal Assessment by IB, We will be following a schedule provided by the Teacher of Computer Science.
